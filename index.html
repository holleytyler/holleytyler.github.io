			I volunteered today at my local animal shelter, as I do every Tuesday, and it both breaks my heart and makes me happy to see all the dogs. I get to walk one, maybe two, dogs every day it always brings me joy. Joy because I know they'll be adopted in short order but sadness because if I could have it my way animal shelters would be obsolete.

			Although I know that's not possible so I do what I can: walking, feeding, and playing with them...even in the freezing cold.
