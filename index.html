			I've decided to continue my minimalistic efforts this evening after class by continuing to declutter the areas I spend the most time in: my office and bedroom. I find the key is to think of when I used each item last and when I think I will use it again.
			<br><br>
			There are two basic rules for this:
			<br>
		</p>
		<ol class=entry>
			<li>90/90 Rule -- If I haven't used it in 90+ days and won't use it again for 90+ days or more, I can dispose of it.</li>
			<li>20/20 Rule -- If I still don't think the above is justified, I think: if I can travel less than 20 minutes and spend less than $20 to re-acquire the item, it's a no brainer.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>
		<p class=entry>
			Of course, there are exceptions to this -- such as expensive things (camera, tv) and seasonal items (gloves, winter coat) but I've found these two rules help me decide on which items I can get rid of.
			<br><br>
			To be clear, by "get rid of" I mostly mean donate or sell but otherwise it does go in the recycling/trash.

			I volunteered today at my local animal shelter, as I do every Tuesday, and it both breaks my heart and makes me happy to see all the dogs. I get to walk one, maybe two, dogs every day it always brings me joy. Joy because I know they'll be adopted in short order but sadness because if I could have it my way animal shelters would be obsolete.
			<br><br>
			Although I know that's not possible so I do what I can: walking, feeding, and playing with them...even in the freezing cold.
