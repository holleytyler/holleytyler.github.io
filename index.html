			Filmmaker Matt D'Avella (director of <i>Minimalism: A Documentary about the Important Things</i>) said in one of his videos, "Humans are very simple creatures. If we see a surface, we will put something on it."
			<br><br>
			This is true for me as well, particularly with laundry. After doing my laundry, often I'll let it pile up on my desk or on my dresser. It''s folded and neat but still in piles. Then every week or two I neatly fold all my t-shirts and shorts and put them in their drawer; and I'll unfold my long sleeves and pants and hang them in the closet.
			<br><br>
			My shortcoming is not doing this more often. When I do get around to tidying up my clothes, I feel a sense of relief and that leads me to declutter the rest of my room.
			<br><br>
			This is why I didn't get past my room and to my office like I planned. I got too carried away in decluttering.
			<br><br>
			What surfaces in your home end up being the destination for the unnecessary?

			I've decided to continue my minimalistic efforts this evening after class by continuing to declutter the areas I spend the most time in: my office and bedroom. I find the key is to think of when I used each item last and when I think I will use it again.
			<br><br>
			There are two basic rules for this:
		</p>
		<ol class=entry>
			<li>90/90 Rule -- If I haven't used it in 90+ days and won't use it again for 90+ days or more, I can dispose of it.</li>
			<li>20/20 Rule -- If I still don't think the above is justified, I think: if I can travel less than 20 minutes and spend less than $20 to re-acquire the item, it's a no brainer.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class=entry>
			Of course, there are exceptions to this -- such as expensive things (camera, tv) and seasonal items (gloves, winter coat) but I've found these two rules help me decide on which items I can get rid of.
			<br><br>
			To be clear, by "get rid of" I mostly mean donate or sell but otherwise it does go in the recycling/trash.

			I volunteered today at my local animal shelter, as I do every Tuesday, and it both breaks my heart and makes me happy to see all the dogs. I get to walk one, maybe two, dogs every day it always brings me joy. Joy because I know they'll be adopted in short order but sadness because if I could have it my way animal shelters would be obsolete.
			<br><br>
			Although I know that's not possible so I do what I can: walking, feeding, and playing with them...even in the freezing cold.
